1. What are the four tags required in every HTML page?
The four tags required in every HTML page are:

1- The <!DOCTYPE> tag, which declares the document type and the HTML version. This tag is not an HTML element, but it is required for HTML documents¹.

2- The <html> tag, which represents the root of an HTML document. This tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag). 

3- The <head> tag, which contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets¹.

4- The <body> tag, which represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document.

2. What is HTML emojis tags and write simple program to disply some emojis?
HTML emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set that are displayed as colorful icons in the browser.
They represent things such as faces, weather, animals, and emotions. To use HTML emojis, you need to specify the character set in the <meta> tag 
as UTF-8, and then use the corresponding code for each emoji. For example, the code for the grinning face emoji is \uD83D\uDE00, which can also
be written as &#128512; or &#x1F600;⁴. Here is a simple program to display some emojis in HTML:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>HTML Emojis</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Some Emojis</h1>
  <p>\uD83D\uDE00 \uD83D\uDE04 \uD83D\uDE0D \uD83D\uDC97</p>
  <p>\uD83D\uDE80 \uD83D\uDE81 \uD83D\uDE82 \uD83D\uDE83 \uD83D\uDE84</p>
  <p>\uD83D\uDC02 \uD83D\uDC03 \uD83D\uDC04 \uD83D\uDC05 \uD83D\uDC06</p>
</body>
